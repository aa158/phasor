# python-BGSF

(Bond Graph)->(Signal Flow)

### TODO
#### code
 * first fitting! needs just a few unit-tests
 * signal processing cleanup
 
 * split outputs of mirrors for eventual modal computations
 * make the port algorithm split into in-out flows (more efficient for the above)
 
 * redesign ports for better semantics across electronics, signals, mechanics (and optics modematching)
 
##### prototypes
 * Fix up the prototyping code to use something like dictkeys, maybe move dictkeys to declarative

#### documentation
 * need to be systematic
