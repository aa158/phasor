make generic coupling attributes for:

RTL transmission coefficients
    dict(R = a, T = b, L = c) RSPEC dictionaries as fast alternatives (choose 2 of three). Need storage mechanism like SimpleUnitfulGroup

complex couplings

polarization specification
    allow single 'S', 'P' strings or dict(S = a, P = b) POLSPEC dictionaries as fast alternatives
